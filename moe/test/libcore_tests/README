 To run all tests you can run:
  run.sh device (to run on device)
  run.sh sim (to run on simulator iphone6)

Script uses tools from ../../../../mdp_msdk-inde-java-xos-tools.

Results you can find out in ./logs folder: 
    log and csv file for each group of tests;
    2 summary files: summaryExt.csv - for packages that customer can use
                     summaryInt.csv - for internal packages

Alternatively tests can be run from xcode by running libcore_tests-Test.app. 
In this case no logs will be created (output in console), csv files can be found:
 for device inside application bundle(how to get it described here, for example,
